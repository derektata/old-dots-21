The modules that make up my status bar.

```
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ gh-notify
â”œâ”€â”€ github
â”œâ”€â”€ network
â”œâ”€â”€ powah.py
â””â”€â”€ volume
```

The `github` script is a module to show me how many unread notifications I have and uses `gh-notify` under the hood. (It's a quick and dirty implementation but it works ðŸ¤·)
