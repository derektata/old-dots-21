The modules that make up my status bar.

```
scripts/
├── gh-notify
├── github
├── network
├── powah.py
└── volume
```

The `github` script is a module to show me how many unread notifications I have and uses `gh-notify` under the hood.

I'm still testing `gh-notify` and will release it once I feel it's ready.
